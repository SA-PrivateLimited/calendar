This Privacy Policy describes how SA-privateLimited.com ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the Hindu Panchang Calendar mobile application ("App").

By using our App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our App.

1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

1.1 Personal Information
Our App is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal personal information:
- User Notes: Any personal notes, reminders, or calendar entries you create within the App are stored locally on your device and optionally synced to our secure Firebase database.
- Device Information: We may collect basic device information (device type, operating system version) to improve app performance and compatibility.
- Usage Data: We may collect anonymous usage statistics to understand how the App is used and to improve user experience.

1.2 Automatically Collected Information
- Calendar Data: The App accesses calendar data (dates, festivals, tithis, nakshatras) which is publicly available information and does not contain personal identifiers.
- Cache Data: The App stores calendar data locally on your device for offline access and faster loading.

2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

We use the collected information for the following purposes:
- To Provide Services: To display calendar information, festivals, tithis, and nakshatras.

3. DATA STORAGE AND SECURITY

3.1 Local Storage
Most of your data, including calendar information and cached content, is stored locally on your device using IndexedDB and browser cache. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to our servers unless you explicitly enable sync.

3.2 Cloud Storage (Firebase)
If you choose to sync your notes across devices, your notes are stored securely on Google Firebase Realtime Database. Firebase uses industry-standard security measures including encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS), secure authentication, and access controls.

Your notes are stored with a unique identifier and are not linked to your personal identity unless you provide such information.

3.3 Data Retention
We retain your personal notes and data for as long as you use the App. If you delete the App or your account, your data will be deleted from our servers within 30 days. Locally stored data on your device will be removed when you uninstall the App.

- Service Providers: We use Firebase (Google) for data storage and analytics. These service providers are bound by their own privacy policies.
- Legal Requirements: We may disclose information if required by law or in response to valid legal requests.
- App Security: We may share information to protect the security and integrity of our App and users.
